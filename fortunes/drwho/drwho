Rose: No.

The Doctor: And I bet you're fussing and moaning now- typical! But hold on and just listen a bit more. The TARDIS can never return for me. Emergency Programme One means I'm facing an enemy that should never get their hands on this machine. So this is what you should do: let the TARDIS die. Just let this old box gather dust. No one can open it; no one will even notice it. Let it become a strange little thing standing on a street corner. And over the years, the world will move on and the box will be buried.

The Beast: You will die here, all of you. This planet is your grave.

The Arkiphets, Quoldonity, Christianity, Pash-Pash, Neo-Judaism, San Claar, Church of the Tin Vagabond. Which Devil are you?
The Beast: All of them.
The Doctor What, then you're the truth behind the myth?
The Beast: This one knows me, as I know him; the killer of his own kind.
The Doctor: [quickly changing the subject] How did you end up on this rock?
The Beast: The Disciples of the Light rose up aginst me and chained me in the Pit for all eternity.

The Beast: Before time.
The Doctor: [incredulous] What does that mean?
The Beast: Before time.

The Beast: Before time and light and space and matter. Before the cataclysm. Before this universe was created.

The Beast: Is that YOUR religion?
The Doctor: It's a belief.

The Doctor: Technology using the one thing a Dalek can¿t do: Touch. Sealed inside your casing, not feeling anything. Ever. From birth to death locked inside a cold, metal cage. Completely alone. That explains your voice- no wonder you scream.
Dalek Sec: The Doctor will open the Ark!
The Doctor: Ha ha, the Doctor will not.
Dalek Sec: You have no way of resisting!
The Doctor: Mm, you got me there. [withdrawing the sonic screwdriver] Although, there is always this.
Dalek Sec: A sonic probe?
The Doctor: [with jocular bravado] That's screwdriver.
Dalek Sec: It is harmless.
The Doctor: Ohh, yes. Harmless is just the word: that's why I like it! Doesn't kill, doesn't wound, doesn't maim. But I'll tell you what it does do: It is very good at opening doors. [He pushes the switch and the doors explode inwards; Jake's squad and some Cybermen run in and open fire.]

Rose: Where are you?
The Doctor: Inside the TARDIS. There's one tiny little gap in the universe left, just about to close. And it takes a lot of power to send this projection- I'm in orbit around a supernova. [smiling weakly] I'm burning up a sun just to say goodbye.
Rose: You look like a ghost.
The Doctor: Hold on- [zaps sonic screwdriver at something out of set and solidifies]
Rose: Can I t- (holds out her hand to his face)
The Doctor: I'm still just an image, no touch.
Rose: Can't you come through properly?
The Doctor: The whole thing would fracture. The two universes would collapse.
Rose: So? [both laugh shakily]
The Doctor: Where are we? Where did the gap come out?
Rose: We're in Norway.
The Doctor: Norway, right.
Rose: About fifty miles out of Bergen. It's called "Darlig Ulv Stranden".
The Doctor: "Dalek"?
Rose: "Darlig". It's Norwegian for bad. This translates as "Bad Wolf Bay". How long have we got?
The Doctor: About two minutes.
Rose: I can't think of what to say.

The Doctor: You still got Mr. Mickey, then?
Rose: Oh there's five of us now. Mum, Dad, Mickey.... and the baby.

Rose: No. It's Mum. She's three months gone. More Tylers on the way.
The Doctor: And what about you? Are you-?
Rose: Yeah, I'm...I'm back working in the shop.
The Doctor: Oh, good for you.
Rose: Shut up. No, I'm not. Torchwood on this earth's open for business. Think I know a thing or two about aliens.
The Doctor: [smiles] Rose Tyler, defender of the Earth... You're dead -officially- back home. So many people died that day and you've gone missing. You're on the list of the dead. [pause] Here you are, living your life day after day. The one adventure I can never have.

The Doctor: You can't.
Rose: What are you going to do?
The Doctor: Back to the TARDIS. Same old life.

The Doctor: Yes.
Rose: I- .... I love you.

Two, don't worry about the TARDIS. I'll put it on emergency power so they can't detect it, just let it hide away. Four, no, wait a minute, three, no getting involved in big historical events. Four, you. Don't let me abandon you. And five-- [Martha fast-forwards the recording]
Martha: But there was a meteor, a shooting star, what am I supposed to do then?
The Doctor: [the recording] And twenty-three, if anything goes wrong, if they find us, Martha, then you know what to do. Open the watch. Everything I am is kept safe in there.

It's an elementary trick in certain parts of the galaxy. [He moves to look at one of the ships machines] But it has gotta be said, I don't like the look of that hydrokinometer.

Baines/Son of Mine: He never raised his voice. That was the worst thing -- the fury of the Time Lord -- and then we discovered why. Why this Doctor, who had fought with gods and demons, why he had run away from us and hidden... He was being kind.
He wrapped my father in unbreakable chains forged in the heart of a dwarf star. He tricked my mother into the event horizon of a collapsing galaxy to be imprisoned there, forever. He still visits my sister, once a year, every year. I wonder if one day he might forgive her, but there she is. Can you see? He trapped her inside a mirror. Every mirror. If ever you look at your reflection and see something move behind you just for a second, that's her. That's always her. As for me, I was suspended in time and the Doctor put me to work standing over the fields of England, as their protector. We wanted to live forever. So the Doctor made sure we did.

Billy: [stunned] But I don't- I can't-
The Doctor: Fascinating race, the Weeping Angels. The only psychopaths in the universe to kill you nicely. No mess, no fuss, they just zap you into the past and let you live to death.

The Doctor: Creatures from another world.
Sally: But they're just statues.
The Doctor: Only when you see them.
Sally: What does that mean?
The Doctor: Lonely Assassins, they used to be called. No one quite knows where they came from, but they're as old as the Universe, or very nearly, and they have survived this long because they have the most perfect defense system ever evolved. They're quantum-locked. They don't exist when they're being observed. The moment they are seen by any other living creature, they freeze into rock. No choice, it's a fact of their biology. In the sight of any living thing they literally turn to stone. And you can't kill a stone. 'Course, a stone can't kill you either, but.... then you turn your head away. Then you blink, and oh yes it can!
Sally: [to Larry, referring to a nearby Angel] Don't take your eyes off that.
The Doctor: That's why they cover their eyes. They're not weeping, they can't risk looking at each other. Their greatest asset is their greatest curse. They can never be seen. Loneliest creatures in the Universe. And I'm sorry. I am very, very sorry- it's up to you now.
Sally: What am I supposed to do?
The Doctor: The blue box; it's my time machine. There is a world of time energy in there that they could feast on forever, but the damage they would do could switch off the sun. You have got to send it back to me.
Sally: How? How?!
The Doctor: And that's it, I'm afraid. There's no more from you on the transcript, that's the last I've got. I don't know what stopped you talking but I can guess. They're coming. The Angels are coming for you, but listen -your life could depend on this- don't blink. Don't even blink. Blink and you're dead. They are fast, faster than you could believe.

Captain Jack: But all the legends of Gallifrey made it sound so perfect.
The Doctor: [musing] Well, perfect to look at, maybe. And it was, it was beautiful. They used to call it the Shining World of the Seven Systems. And on the continent of Wild Endeavour, in the mountains of Solace and Solitude, there stood the Citadel of the Time Lords. The oldest and most mighty race in the universe. Looking down on the galaxies below, sworn never to interfere, only to watch. Children of Gallifrey were taken from their families at the age of eight, to enter the Academy. Some say that's where it all began, when he was a child. That's when the Master saw eternity. As a novice, he was taken for initiation. He stood in front of the Untempered Schism. It's a gap in the fabric of reality through which could be seen the whole of the vortex. We stand there, eight years old, staring at the raw power of Time and Space, just a child. Some would be inspired. Some would run away. And some would go mad. [beat.] Oh, I dunno.

Doctor: You can't win. No one can. You don't even know why you're here. Your whole history, it's just Chinese whispers, getting more distorted the more its passed on. This [gesturing at the Terraforming device] is the Source. This is what you're fighting over, a device to rejuvenate a planet's ecosystem, its nothing mystical, its from a laboratory, not some creator. Its a bubble of gases, a cocktail of stuff for accelerated evolution. Methane, hydrogen, ammonia, amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids. It's used to make barren planet habitable. Look around you. It's not for killing, its for bringing life. If you allow it, it can lift you out of these dark tunnels and into the bright, bright sunlight. No more fighting, no more killing. [Lifts the Source] I'm the Doctor and I declare this war is OVER! [Throws the Source to the ground for it to smash and release the terramorphic gases].
