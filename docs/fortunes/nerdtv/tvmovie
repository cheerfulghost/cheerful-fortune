Three brave men went searching
For a fortune in the west
Now they face each other in the dawn

The finale of their dream
In the land of cottage cream
Turned against their fellows in their quest for jam and scones.. scOnes

Men called him wild Bill Oddie
And his friend was Texas Tim
They walked tall with their tomatoes in their hands

Their foe was greedy Graeme
Who felt sure that he could slay 'em
With his pair of bright red squirters ...??
.....??

On and on strode Graeme
On and on strode Bill and Tim
Until they stood there silent; face to faces

Then Graeme quietly spoke
As he pulled his master stroke
By suggesting that they turn around and walk eleven paces

1..2..3..4..5..6..7..8..9..10..
(Bill Oddie and Tim Brooke Taylor walk into a wall)

All hell broke loose in Penanink..
...??...

And nobody can say,
How much sauce was spilt that day
But by the end those two brave men were lying in the dust.

His chums lay in the ketchup
And his girl ran to his arms
But even as they kissed, she met her doom.

For if you double-cross a friend
You'll get squirted in the end

Rene Belloq:  You and I are very much alike.  Archaeology is our religion,
  yet we have both fallen from the pure faith.  Our methods have not
  differed as much as you pretend.  I am but a shadowy reflection of you.
  It would take only a nudge to make you like me.  To push you out of the
  light.

"They use their tongues to deceive. The venom of snakes is under their
lips! Their mouths are full of bitterness and curses!  And in their
paths, nothing but ruin and misery, and the fear of God is not before
their eyes!  They have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders.  They
have recruited the rich and the powerful.  And they have *blinded* us to
the truth!  Our human spirit is corrupted. *Why* do we worship greed?
Because, outside the limit of our sight, *feeding* off us, perched on
top of us, from birth to death, are our *owners*!  Our owners!  They
have us.  They control us!  They are our *masters*!  Wake up!  They're
all about you.  All around you."

rights are nonexistent.  They have created a repressive society, and we

have made us indifferent -- to ourselves, to others.  We are focused
only on our own gain."

Dr. Cameron: I worked very hard to get where I am!
Dr. Gregory House: You didn't have to. People choose the paths that gain them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort. That's a law of nature, and you defied it. That's why I hired you. You could've married rich, you could've been a model, you could've just shown up and people would've given you stuff - lots of stuff - but you didn't. You worked your stunning little ass off.

Dr. Lisa Cuddy: He has a sore throat.
Dr. Gregory House: Of *course*! Yes! Why didn't I... He... He said that it hurt and I should have deduced that it was sore.

Jill: My joints have been feeling all loose, and lately I've been feeling sick a lot. Maybe I'm overtraining; I'm doin' the marathon, like, ten miles a day,
[House looks tired]
Jill: but I can't seem to lose any weight.
Dr. Gregory House: Lift up your arms.
[she does so]
Dr. Gregory House: You have a parasite.
Jill: Like a tapeworm or something?
Dr. Gregory House: Lie back and lift up your sweater.
[she lies back, and still has her hands up.]
Dr. Gregory House: You can put your arms down.
Jill: Can you do anything about it?
Dr. Gregory House: Only for about a month or so. After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple of states.
[he starts to ultrasound her abdomen]
Jill: Illegal?
Dr. Gregory House: Don't worry. Many women learn to embrace this parasite. They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites -
Jill: Playdates?
Dr. Gregory House: [shows her the ultrasound] It has your eyes.

Lucy Palermo: [Lucy is reading aloud "Her Praise" by W.B. Yeats]
Lucy Palermo: I will talk no more of books or of the long war but walk by the dry thorn until I have found some beggar shelter from the wind and there manage the talk until her name come round. If there be rags enough he will know her name and be well pleased remembering it. For in the old days though she had young men's praise and old men's blame among the poor both the old and young gave her praise.

Dr. Cameron: I'm the only one who's always stood behind you when you've screwed up.
Dr. Gregory House: Why? Why would you support someone who screws up?
Dr. Cameron: Because I'm not insanely insecure, and because I can actually trust in another human being, and I am not an angry, misanthropic son of a bitch.

Dr. Gregory House: [examining a baby] No fever, glands normal. Missing her vaccination dates.
Young Mother: We're not vaccinating.
Dr. Gregory House: Think they don't work?
Young Mother: I think some multinational pharmaceutical company wants me to think they work. Pad their bottom line.
Dr. Gregory House: Mmmm. May I?
[he takes the baby's frog and starts to do a gribbit noise with the baby]
Young Mother: [whispered] Sure.
Dr. Gregory House: Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit.
[the baby laughs]
Dr. Gregory House: All natural, no dyes. That's a good business - all-natural children's toys. Those toy companies, they don't arbitrarily mark up their frogs. They don't lie about how much they spend in research and development. The worst a toy company can be accused of is making a really boring frog. Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit. You know another really good business? Teeny tiny baby coffins. You can get them in frog green or fire engine red. Really. The antibodies in yummy mummy only protect the kid for six months, which is why these companies think they can gouge you. They think that you'll spend whatever they ask to keep your kid alive. Want to change things? Prove them wrong. A few hundred parents like you decide they'd rather let their kid die then cough up 40 bucks for a vaccination, believe me, prices will drop *really* fast. Gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit, gribbit.
Young Mother: Tell me what she has.
Dr. Gregory House: [long suffering] A cold.
